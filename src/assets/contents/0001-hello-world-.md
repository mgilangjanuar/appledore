Hello, humans!

I rewrite my personal website (~~mgilangjanuar.com~~) to [appledore.dev](https://appledore.dev) as a new home. I hope this is can be a place for me to share my thoughts and ideas. I also hope this is can be a place for me to learn and improve my skills.

I don't know if people still read blogs, or trust the AI assistant as their source of information nowadays. All of the content on this website is opinion-oriented, and I don't guarantee that it's 100% correct. I'm just a human, and I'm still learning. I'm just a human who wants to learn and share my knowledge based on my experience.

This blog doesn't have a specific topic or length. I will write about anything that I want to share with you. I will write about my experience, my thoughts, my ideas, my learnings, my life, my hobbies, my interests, my mistakes, my failures, my regrets, my dreams, my goals, my ambitions, my fears, my doubts, my insecurities, my happiness, my joy, my gratitude, and etcetera.

Happy reading!
